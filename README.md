# Madlibs_Game

I have developed a text based, fill in the blank Mablibs Game.

## Working of Game

There are 3 levels in the game to choose from:
- Easy 
- Medium
- Hard

There will be series of questions asked to the playe/user after selecting the level.


## Conclusion

It is a great starter project to have hands on experienc and learnign python by using 
- List 
- Arrays 
- Functions
- Conditional statements 
- Working with strings
- Taking user inputs (input/output)
